## Heavy Thinking Integration

Khi task difficulty <85% confidence, sử dụng K=8 parallel reasoning chains.

### Khi nào kích hoạt K=8

| Trigger | Điều kiện | Approach |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Easy Mode** | Cả 3 Pain Point clear, confidence >85% | Direct 3-phase, skip K=8 |
| **Hard Mode** | Ambiguous requirements, multiple valid interpretations | Activate K=8 chains |

### K=8 Chain Allocation

```yaml
Pillar 1 (Knowledge): 2 chains
  - Chain 1: Domain knowledge requirements
  - Chain 2: knowledge/ folder structure

Pillar 2 (Process): 3 chains
  - Chain 3: Workflow logic analysis
  - Chain 4: Phase ordering
  - Chain 5: Interaction points

Pillar 3 (Guardrails): 3 chains
  - Chain 6: Zone applicability
  - Chain 7: Risk identification
  - Chain 8: Open question surfacing
```

### Two-Stage Processing

```
Stage 1: 8 independent chains → parallel execution
Stage 2: Synthesize → select best from each chain, resolve conflicts
Output: Phase 2/3 deliverables
```

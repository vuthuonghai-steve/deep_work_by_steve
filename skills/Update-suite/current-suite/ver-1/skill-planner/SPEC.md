# skill-planner Technical Specification

## 1. Semantic Questions

When reading this skill, the LLM must be able to answer:

| # | Question | Answerable From |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| **Q1** | Is this a command or reference data? | SKILL.md `name` + `description` frontmatter |
| **Q2** | Is this a hard rule or soft suggestion? | SKILL.md `constraints` YAML block (must/must_not) |
| **Q3** | When is this information always needed vs context-dependent? | SKILL.md `progressive_disclosure` tiers |
| **Q4** | What is example vs criteria? | `loop/plan-checklist.yaml` vs `knowledge/` files |
| **Q5** | When conflict occurs, which takes priority? | SKILL.md `priority_order` in AI-FIRST CONFIGURATION |

---

## 2. Format Requirements

Based on CLAUDE.md §3 format selection:

```yaml
format_rules:
  markdown:
    use_for:
      - explanation: "SKILL.md workflow description, rationale, Step instructions"
      - walkthrough: "Boot sequence, progressive writing contract"
      - overview: "Multi-perspective analysis, 4 perspectives table"
    avoid_for:
      - hard_rules_without_schema: "Use YAML in Guardrails instead"

  yaml:
    use_for:
      - constraints: "progressive_disclosure tiers, output_contract, priority_order"
      - checklists: "loop/plan-checklist.yaml quality gates"
      - routing: "pipeline stage_order, dependencies, successor_hints"
    avoid_for:
      - long_prose: "Step instructions stay in Markdown"

  xml_like_tags:
    use_for:
      - semantic_boundaries: "<instructions>, <context> in Step descriptions"
      - separating_input: "When user input wraps requirements"
    avoid_for:
      - excessive_micro_tagging: "Step steps already have clear boundaries"
```

## 3. Token Budget

Based on CLAUDE.md §6 Layer Model:

```yaml
token_budget:
  L0_anchor_rules:
    limit: 350 tokens
    actual: "~280 tokens (SKILL.md frontmatter + core directives)"
    status: "✅ GOOD"
    split_when: ">400 tokens"

  L1_working_policy:
    limit: 1000 tokens
    actual: "~620 tokens (Guardrails YAML + Workflow Steps + Error Handling)"
    status: "✅ GOOD"
    split_when: ">1200 tokens"

  L2_domain_context:
    limit: 2500 tokens
    actual: "~350 tokens (knowledge/ referenced, not inlined)"
    status: "✅ GOOD"
    split_when: ">3000 tokens"

  root_guide_total:
    limit: 1800 tokens
    actual: "~1250 tokens (SKILL.md full)"
    status: "✅ EXCELLENT"
    split_when: ">2500 tokens"

  format_distribution:
    markdown_body: "~980 tokens (78%)"
    yaml_frontmatter: "~180 tokens (14%)"
    tables: "~90 tokens (8%)"
```

    implementation:
      - "[TỪ DESIGN §N] — from confirmed design.md"
      - "[GỢI Ý BỔ SUNG] — planner's suggestion, not in design"
      - "[TỪ AUDIT TÀI NGUYÊN] — generated from resource gap"
      - "[CẦN LÀM RÕ] — requires user clarification"
    violation: "Unlabeled content appearing as fact"

  AH5_blocker_tracking:
    description: "Blockers must be tracked and resolved"
    implementation:
      - "Blockers array present in todo.md"
      - "Unresolved blockers prevent ready_for_builder"

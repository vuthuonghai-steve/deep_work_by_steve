# skill-builder Technical Specification (Ver_3.0.0 - Physical Micro-skills)

## 1. Semantic Questions

When reading this skill, the LLM must be able to answer:

| # | Question | Answerable From |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| **Q1** | Is this a command or reference data? | SKILL.md `name` + `description` frontmatter |
| **Q2** | Is this a hard rule or soft suggestion? | SKILL.md `constraints` YAML block (must/must_not) |
| **Q3** | When is this information always needed vs context-dependent? | SKILL.md `progressive_disclosure` tiers |
| **Q4** | What is example vs criteria? | `loop/build-checklist.yaml` vs `knowledge/` files |
| **Q5** | When conflict occurs, which takes priority? | SKILL.md `priority_order` in AI-FIRST CONFIGURATION |

---

## 2. Format Requirements

Based on CLAUDE.md §3 format selection:

```yaml
format_rules:
  markdown:
    use_for:
      - explanation: "SKILL.md workflow description, persona, Phase instructions"
      - walkthrough: "Boot sequence, build examples"
      - overview: "Mission, error policy, tools"
    avoid_for:
      - hard_rules_without_schema: "Use YAML in Guardrails instead"

  yaml:
    use_for:
      - constraints: "progressive_disclosure tiers, output_contract, priority_order"
      - checklists: "loop/build-checklist.yaml quality gates"
      - routing: "pipeline stage_order, dependencies"
    avoid_for:
      - long_prose: "Phase instructions stay in Markdown"

  xml_like_tags:
    use_for:
      - semantic_boundaries: "<instructions>, <context> in Phase descriptions"
      - separating_input: "When user input wraps requirements"
    avoid_for:
      - excessive_micro_tagging: "Phase steps already have clear boundaries"
```

## 3. Token Budget

Based on CLAUDE.md §6 Layer Model:

```yaml
token_budget:
  L0_anchor_rules:
    limit: 350 tokens
    actual: "~260 tokens (SKILL.md frontmatter + core directives)"
    status: "✅ GOOD"
    split_when: ">400 tokens"

  L1_working_policy:
    limit: 1000 tokens
    actual: "~580 tokens (Guardrails YAML + Phases + Error Policy)"
    status: "✅ GOOD"
    split_when: ">1200 tokens"

  L2_domain_context:
    limit: 2500 tokens
    actual: "~320 tokens (knowledge/ referenced, not inlined)"
    status: "✅ GOOD"
    split_when: ">3000 tokens"

  root_guide_total:
    limit: 1800 tokens
    actual: "~1160 tokens (SKILL.md full)"
    status: "✅ EXCELLENT"
    split_when: ">2500 tokens"

  format_distribution:
    markdown_body: "~880 tokens (76%)"
    yaml_frontmatter: "~160 tokens (14%)"
    tables: "~120 tokens (10%)"
```

    path: ".skill-context/{skill-name}/"
    created_by: "skill-architect scripts"
    builder_outputs:
      - "{skills_root}/{skill-name}/"  # The built skill
      - "build-log.md"                 # Execution evidence
    contents:
      - "design.md (Architect output)"
      - "todo.md (Planner output)"
